    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is important. This privacy policy governs the use of the Nubo mobile application developed by Clicksie LLC.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Logging into the nubo app is optional, unless the user wants to collaborate with other caregivers or backup data to restore later. If the user does not log in, no user or child data is uploaded to our servers. The profile info you provide about your baby (name, date of birth, picture), hereafter referred to Baby Profile, and all logged activities, hereafter referred to as Baby Logs, will not be stored on our servers. They are stored locally on your mobile device in a secure encrypted manner.</li>
        <li>When a user logs in, we do not store explicit usernames or passwords. Login information is provided by third party authenticators, like Apple (on iOS) and Google (on Android). We store the secure anonymous login information provided by these third party services on our servers to identify the user. Please see their respective privacy policies: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/sign-in-with-apple/">Sign in with Apple</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/">Sign in with Google</a>. </li>
        <li>Even when a user logs into the app, the Baby Profile and Baby Logs are locally stored on your mobile and not on our servers. If you choose to backup the Baby Profile and Baby Logs, then we store an encrypted version on your iCloud (if Signed in with Apple) or Google Drive (if signed in with Google).</li>
        <li>When a user establishes a collaborator, the user agrees to share the Baby Profile and Baby Logs with the collaborator. When a user collaborates with other caregivers, then the relationship between the caregivers is stored on our servers. Each caregiver maintains their own copy of Baby Profile and Baby Logs on their respective mobiles. When a caregiver adds, deletes or updates the Baby Logs, then only the changes are transferred to other caregivers via our servers in an encrypted manner unreadable by our servers. These changes persist on our servers until delivered to all the collaborators.</li>
        <li>We collect anonymous usage data about the performance of the app and various features provided by the app. This is primarily to help improve the app. No identifiable user or child data is collected.</li>
        <li>This Privacy policy may be updated from time to time. It is recommended to review the Privacy policy regularly for any changes and the continued use of the app is deemed approval of all changes.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us via email: developer@clicksie.io</li>

    </ol>

    <p>This version of the privacy policy is effective as of 01/01/2023.</p>
